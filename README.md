# Omarchy Zen Themes Sync

Syncs Omarchy's Pywal palette into Zen Browser — pure CSS, no extensions, no privileged preferences, no native host, no background daemon, and **live theme switches with no browser restart**. Install as an Omarchy shell plugin or standalone script. Survives Zen updates gracefully.

> **Started as a fork of [gstrand99/zen-auto-style](https://github.com/gstrand99/zen-auto-style)** by Gregory Strand (MIT) — original template, CSS and extension. It has since grown well past its source: Omarchy 4.x support, a hardened CSS-only install, WCAG-legible theming, themed selection on every site, and live reload with no extension or weakened prefs. The original extension lives on unchanged in [`legacy/`](legacy/).

## Screenshots

Themes used, left to right: **Osiris**, **Woman with Floral Composition**, **BlackTurq**. Osiris is available from [xElectric9177/Osiris](https://github.com/xElectric9177/Osiris); Woman with Floral Composition is found through the [omarchy-themes plugin](https://omarchyplugins.com/plugin.html?id=gotar.omarchy-themes) (install themes directly from the marketplace); BlackTurq is available from [HANCORE-linux/omarchy-blackturq-theme](https://github.com/HANCORE-linux/omarchy-blackturq-theme).

## Why Omarchy Zen?

- **Live theme switches, no browser restart** — run `./live.sh enable` once and every later `omarchy theme set` repaints Zen in about a second. You never close and reopen the browser to change themes again. Opt-in: one `sudo` prompt, then it stays out of the way.
- **No privileged prefs** — only `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets = true` (Mozilla standard). No `xpinstall.signatures.required=false`, no `extensions.experiments.enabled=true`.
- **Pure CSS bridge** — Omarchy renders `custom-zen.css.tpl` → `~/.local/state/omarchy/current/theme/custom-zen.css`, Zen reads it via symlink in `chrome/custom-zen.css`.
- **Themed text selection** — selected text in browser controls, internal pages, and websites uses the theme's selection background and foreground colors.
- **Guaranteed legibility (WCAG AA)** — the renderer binary-searches the minimum adjustment that keeps accent-derived text readable against the panel, in both light and dark palettes.
- **Resilient** — every `var(--custom-zen-*)` has a fallback (`#24283b`, `#7aa2f7` etc.). If Zen renames a selector, the `:root` layer still cascades; `verify.sh` checks the selectors after a Zen update.
- **Omarchy-native** — ships as a `service` plugin (`Service.qml`) that auto-runs `install.sh` on shell start. Also works standalone.

## Install

### Option A — As Omarchy plugin (recommended)

```bash
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/Davidxap/omarchy-zen.git --enable
# Service auto-runs install.sh on next shell start. Or run now:
~/.config/omarchy/plugins/io.github.davidxap.omarchy-zen/install.sh
```

**One restart, ever.** Restart Zen a single time to load `userChrome.css`, then run `./live.sh enable` (one `sudo` prompt) and restart once more. From that point on, changing themes never requires closing the browser again — see [Live reload](#live-reload-optional-no-extension).

### Option B — Standalone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Davidxap/omarchy-zen.git
cd omarchy-zen
./check.sh && ./install.sh
```

Both install:

- `~/.config/omarchy/themed/custom-zen.css.tpl` (Pywal template)
- `~/.config/omarchy/hooks/theme-set.d/00-zen-auto-style` (hook — re-renders the sheet from the resolved palette and posts a desktop notification when the theme changes; `00-` so it runs before the slow app-retint hooks)
- `~/.local/state/zen-auto-style/render-custom-zen.py` (deterministic renderer used by the hook and the installer fallback)
- Zen profile `chrome/zen-auto-style-chrome.css`, `zen-auto-style-content.css`, `chrome/custom-zen.css` → symlink
- `user.js` pref `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets`

Restart Zen once → `omarchy theme set <name>` → the hook re-renders the sheet and notifies you with the theme name. With [live reload](#live-reload-optional-no-extension) enabled, the new palette appears immediately.

## How it works

1. Omarchy renders `custom-zen.css` from `custom-zen.css.tpl` using current palette (`~/.local/state/omarchy/current/theme/` on 4.x, fallback `~/.config/omarchy/current/theme/`).
2. Installer symlinks it into Zen's `chrome/` as `custom-zen.css`.
3. Managed `@import` blocks in `userChrome.css`/`userContent.css` load themed vars.
4. The `theme-set` hook re-renders the sheet deterministically from the resolved `colors.toml` (Omarchy skips template renders when the theme ships its own `custom-zen.css` or a theme switch was interrupted) and notifies with the theme name.
5. `omarchy theme refresh` regenerates the stylesheet (install wraps it in a timeout and verifies the result, re-rendering from `colors.toml` on mismatch); next Zen restart picks it up via symlink.

No extension, no host, no background process.

## Requirements

- Omarchy with `omarchy` on PATH
- Zen Browser opened at least once
- Bash + `awk grep sed install mktemp`

No `python`/`zip`/`jq` needed (except `jq` for legacy reconciler cleanup).

## Plugin details

- **ID:** `io.github.davidxap.omarchy-zen` (display name: **Omarchy Zen Themes Sync**)
- **Kind:** `service` → `Service.qml` (auto-installs on `Component.onCompleted` via `Quickshell.Io.Process`)
- **Validation:** `omarchy plugin validate ./` + `/usr/lib/qt6/bin/qmllint -I /usr/share/omarchy/shell Service.qml`
- Disable leaves wiring intact; explicit `./uninstall.sh` to revert (or `~/.config/omarchy/plugins/io.github.davidxap.omarchy-zen/uninstall.sh`).

## Verification

```bash
./verify.sh              # extracts omni.ja, checks #zen-* / .zen-* / --zen-* still exist
./test-fresh-install.sh  # throwaway profile in /tmp, no touch to real ~/.config/zen
```

All `var()` have fallbacks; warnings in `verify.sh` are non-fatal (cascade still provides colors).

### Testing with a clean Zen profile

To test the plugin in a clean state (no Zen Mods, no third-party extensions, no leftover CSS):

1. **Back up** your current Zen profile `chrome/` directory.
2. **Empty** `userChrome.css` and `userContent.css` (set to empty files).
3. **Remove** all `zen-auto-style-*` files, `zen-themes.css`, `zen-themes/`, and `custom-zen.css` from `chrome/`.
4. **Run** `./install.sh` from the plugin directory.
5. **Restart Zen** and verify the theme loads without visual artifacts.

Zen Mods (e.g. Better Letterboxing) and other CSS extensions can inject gradients, shadows, or borders that interfere with the plugin's theming. If you see unexpected lines or color artifacts, test with a clean profile first to isolate the issue.

## Uninstall

Two install types exist — use the matching removal:

**Standalone install** (cloned repo + `./install.sh`, not registered in Omarchy):

```bash
./uninstall.sh
```

**Omarchy plugin install** (via `omarchy plugin install`, registered):

```bash
~/.config/omarchy/plugins/io.github.davidxap.omarchy-zen/uninstall.sh
omarchy plugin remove io.github.davidxap.omarchy-zen --yes
```

`omarchy plugin remove` alone only unregisters the plugin; it does **not**
remove the Zen wiring (by design — the service never auto-uninstalls CSS).
Run `uninstall.sh` first for the wiring, then `plugin remove` if registered.
If `plugin remove` says "not installed", yours was a standalone install:
`uninstall.sh` alone is the complete removal.

Removes hook, managed imports, pref (preserving user CSS outside blocks), template if unchanged, legacy host/artifacts, ghost `zen-auto-style@omarchy.local` from `prefs.js`/`weave/addonsreconciler.json` (requires Zen closed). Restart Zen after uninstall — a running Zen keeps the old theme in memory.

## Theme switch behavior

By default Zen reads `userChrome.css` only at startup, so a new palette needs a **Zen restart** after `omarchy theme set`. The theme-set hook posts a desktop notification — `Theme changed: <theme>` — so you always know which palette is now current.

### Live reload (optional, no extension)

> **You do not have to close and reopen Zen to change themes.** After a single `./live.sh enable`, `omarchy theme set` repaints the browser in about a second — sidebar, toolbar, menus, new tab and text selection, all live.

```bash
./live.sh enable    # asks for sudo once; restart Zen one last time
./live.sh status
./live.sh disable
```

From then on every theme switch repaints Zen within about a second, no restart. It uses Firefox's built-in [autoconfig](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/customizing-firefox-using-autoconfig) instead of an extension: `live/omarchy-zen.cfg` is copied into Zen's install dir and, at startup, polls `chrome/custom-zen.css` once per second and re-registers its `--custom-zen-*` variables when the file changes.

- **No** extension, native host, open port, daemon, signature bypass or experiments pref.
- **Tradeoff:** it writes two root-owned files into the Zen install dir (`omarchy-zen.cfg`, `defaults/pref/omarchy-zen-prefs.js`) and runs that script with browser privileges. It is ~70 readable lines; it only reads the palette file and registers CSS.
- Inert on profiles without Omarchy Zen, survives `zen-browser-bin` upgrades (pacman keeps unowned files), refuses to overwrite another autoconfig loader. `uninstall.sh` disables it.

### Dark Reader sync (optional, needs the Dark Reader extension)

Live reload themes Zen itself. To make **web pages** follow the theme too, this fork can drive [Dark Reader](https://darkreader.org/) (dynamic mode) from the same palette: background, text, selection and light/dark mode, live, no page reload.

```bash
./live.sh enable                 # once (sudo): installs the autoconfig with the Dark Reader hook
./live.sh darkreader enable      # copies two small modules into <profile>/chrome/omarchy-dr/ (no sudo)
./live.sh darkreader status      # enabled | enabled, outdated | disabled
./live.sh darkreader disable
```

Install Dark Reader yourself, turn its **Sync settings off**, and restart Zen once. Everything is opt-in: without `chrome/omarchy-dr/` the autoconfig does nothing extra. Links and accents are left to Dark Reader's own algorithm on purpose, and sites it already treats as dark (Spotify, Netflix, ...) stay untouched unless you add them to its "enabled for" list.

How it works: Dark Reader only accepts theme changes from its own UI pages, so a hidden Dark Reader options page is kept in the Zen window and a small window actor in that page forwards the palette. It relies on Gecko internals, so it is best-effort: any failure is swallowed (30 retries, then it waits for the next theme change). `python3 tools/test-dark-reader.py` checks it end to end on a throwaway headless Zen (needs `geckodriver`). Inspect it from the Browser Console with `ChromeUtils.importESModule("resource://omarchy-dr/OmarchyDR.sys.mjs").debug`.

## Legibility guarantees (1.2.0)

Pywal palettes occasionally ship a low-contrast foreground/background pair or a washed-out accent, which can make typed text unreadable. The 1.2.0 renderer fixes this at the source: accent-derived colors (selected tab, menu hover, URL suggestions) are no longer a blind `color-mix` — the renderer **binary-searches the minimum darkening/lightening that reaches WCAG AA (≥4.5:1) against the panel**, per theme mode (light/dark). Menus and panels pin background **and** foreground to the same palette pair (the old version reverted the popup background to native white, producing white-on-white in dark themes). The result is that *every* theme — light or dark — keeps legible text.

## Performance

The service re-runs `install.sh` on every shell start, but the install is gated: if the plugin version and wiring are unchanged, the script exits in milliseconds with no writes and no backups. Backups are rotated (last 5 kept) and file writes only happen when content actually changed (`cmp` before every `install`).

## Legacy

Original XPI + Python host in [`legacy/`](legacy/) — not installed, kept for reference. Superseded by `live.sh`, which gives the same live reload without `xpinstall.signatures.required=false` or `extensions.experiments.enabled=true`. See `legacy/README.md`.

## Credits

Two people besides the maintainer have work merged into this repository right now. Both of them are why it is better than the thing it started as.

- **David Arturo Arroyave Pérez** ([Davidxap](https://github.com/Davidxap)) — maintainer. Omarchy 4.x compat, CSS-only hardening, WCAG-legible theming, themed selection, live reload without extensions, and the `Omarchy Zen Themes Sync` plugin packaging.
- **Gregory Strand** ([gstrand99](https://github.com/gstrand99)) — released the original [`zen-auto-style`](https://github.com/gstrand99/zen-auto-style) (template, CSS, extension) under MIT, and two of his commits (`3c844a4`, `0ea205a`) are still the foundation this repo is built on. His extension ships unchanged in [`legacy/`](legacy/). Thank you for building something worth forking — and for licensing it so anyone else could.
- **BrunnoVert** ([caniswim](https://github.com/caniswim)) — opened [PR #2](https://github.com/Davidxap/omarchy-zen/pull/2), merged as `40dbcc8`: he moved the `::selection` rules out of the `@-moz-document` URL-matched scope so page text selection follows the active theme on **every** website instead of only the pattern-matched ones. That is the headline feature of 1.3.0. Thank you for the careful CSS work.

## Changelog

### Unreleased
- **Dark Reader sync (opt-in)** — `./live.sh darkreader enable` makes web pages follow the Omarchy palette (background, text, selection, light/dark) live through Dark Reader's dynamic theme. Includes `tools/test-dark-reader.py`, an end-to-end check on a throwaway headless Zen.

### 1.4.2
- **The toast clears half as fast** — `Theme changed: <theme>` is posted at `low` urgency. The shell clamps a toast to a floor of 8s for `normal` and 5s for `low`, so `normal` was pinning it on screen for eight seconds. Five seconds is the floor; nothing shorter is reachable from a sender.

### 1.4.1
- **Notification no longer waits for the whole theme switch** — the hook is installed as `00-zen-auto-style` instead of `zen-auto-style`. `omarchy-hook theme-set` runs `theme-set.d/*` in alphabetical order and blocks on each one, so the old name sorted *after* the slow app-retint hooks (VS Code, Firefox, Zen, theme extras) and `Theme changed: <theme>` only appeared once they had all finished. It now runs first in the loop.
- Credits rewritten: every contributor named, with the exact PR/commit each one shipped.

### 1.4.0
- **Live theme reload without extensions (opt-in)** — `./live.sh enable` installs a Firefox autoconfig script that re-applies the palette within a second of `omarchy theme set`, no Zen restart. Replaces the legacy XPI path and its two security-sensitive prefs. Verified on Zen 1.22.3b (Firefox 156) for atomic file swaps and in-place rewrites.
- The theme-set notification now reads `Theme changed: <theme>` — theme name only, no restart nag.

### 1.3.0
- **Themed text selection on every website** — the content stylesheet's `::selection` rules now sit *outside* the `@-moz-document` URL scope, so page selection follows the palette on all sites instead of only the matched ones; the browser chrome gets its own `::selection` too. ([#2](https://github.com/Davidxap/omarchy-zen/pull/2), thanks [caniswim](https://github.com/caniswim) / BrunnoVert.)
- **Stale-stylesheet install bug fixed** — the installer's fast path compared nothing before skipping, so a changed template could ship with the previous render. It now `cmp`s the deployed file against a fresh render. Reproduced on `main` before the fix; passes after.
- **Verified legibility of the selection pair** — all 22 shipped themes measure ≥4.5:1 (WCAG AA) on their selection foreground/background (worst: 4.88:1).

### 1.2.0
- **Guaranteed legibility across light and dark themes** — the renderer binary-searches accent-derived colors to WCAG AA (≥4.5:1) against the panel instead of a blind `color-mix`; menus/panels always pin background + foreground to the same palette pair (fixes white-on-white in dark themes).
- **Deterministic theme→Zen sync** — the `theme-set` hook re-renders the sheet from the resolved `colors.toml` and notifies with the theme name; the installer wraps `omarchy theme refresh` in a timeout and verifies the rendered background, re-rendering on mismatch.
- **Install hardening** — `timeout` on refresh, post-install palette verification with a deterministic re-render fallback, and a fast-path re-check so unchanged installs exit in milliseconds.
- **Reusable deterministic renderer** — `tools/render-custom-zen.py` shared by the hook, the installer fallback, and the screenshot pipeline.
- **Branded theme screenshots** — Osiris, Woman with Floral Composition, and BlackTurq; preview shows Osiris.

### 1.0.3
- **Sidebar seam fixed** — no more vertical line between sidebar and content.
- **Testing docs** — clean-profile instructions for troubleshooting; marketplace preview image.

### 1.0.2
- **Bounded installer output** — byte-ceiling guards so a runaway loop can't fill the log.

### 1.0.1
- **Marketplace validation fixes** — the Quickshell `StdioCollector` is now bounded (it was unbounded, a memory ceiling risk in a long-lived shell); `uninstall.sh` gained a proper `backup_file()` and restructured guards so cleanup only runs against a real Zen profile.
- **Sidebar gaps closed** — no black/white line at the top of the sidebar, and correct edge colours in light and dark themes.

### 1.0.0
- **First marketplace release** — plugin id `io.github.davidxap.omarchy-zen`, headless Quickshell service, installer/uninstaller, plus `check.sh`, `verify.sh`, and `test-fresh-install.sh` as repo gates.
- **Rebrand to Omarchy Zen Themes Sync** — CSS-only install path, with the legacy live-reload extension moved to `legacy/`.
